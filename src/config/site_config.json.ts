        //     abstract: "The “lack of interpretability” and the “constraints of the scaling law” are two major bottlenecks in deep learning, but they fundamentally converge on the same root cause—the absence of a foundational explanation, localization, and debugging representation problems of a neural network. Currently, most explainable AI research remains at the engineering level, and fails to build up a theoretical connection between the “detailed knowledge representation” and “generalization power.” The interaction-based Interpretability theory proposed by Dr. Quanshi Zhang has partially addressed these issues from a new perspective. It rigorously demonstrates that the complex inference logic of neural networks can be comprehensively summarized as sparse interactions. Based on these interactions, the theory successfully explains the root causes of neural network performance, thereby breaking free from the black-box training paradigm. This enables real-time monitoring and correction of model representation flaws, improving training and testing efficiency, and ultimately overcoming the constraints of the scaling law.",

        //     abstract: "In deep learning, the perspective on memorization of training examples is undergoing a paradigm shift. Previously linked to overfitting and poor generalization, memorization is now seen as benign, beneficial or concerning, depending on the data involved. This shift raises questions about the mystery that is memorization: what should and shouldn't models memorize, how is memorization implemented internally, and, more fundamentally, can we talk about memorization as a phenomenon that is separate from generalization or is this a myth? In this talk, I will provide you with the lay of the land on memorization analyses from a behavioural and model-internal perspective, reflecting on the pressing challenges it poses for interpretability research and why I think we should not shy away from them.",

She obtained her PhD from the University of Edinburgh, UK, as part of the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Natural Language Processing, under the supervision of Ivan Titov.
